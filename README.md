CP is so hard

So as of 11/17/19 I have decided to start writing motivations to questions, in part so I actually remember them on USACO.

Additionally it would make it harder for me to copy the editorial mindlessly, which is honestly the only way for me to solve some questions since I suck.

In div1+div2 rounds, questions are div2 unless otherwise stated.

So as of 3/2/20 (super tuesday!!!!) I have started putting AIME problems that are DP'able by hand so I can doubly practice math and CS, as I am very low on time. I do not know the effectiveness but there are many such problems on AIME and USACO so it should be at least a little.

To-do: 2018 AIME I/14
