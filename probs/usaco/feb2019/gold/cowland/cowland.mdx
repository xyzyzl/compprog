**Time Complexity:** $O((n+q) \lg n)$

**Main Idea:** We use Euler tour technique to initialize a binary indexed tree, and use the binary indexed tree to run range xor queries.

Let $e_x$ be the enjoyment values for each of the attractions, and $lca(i, j)$ be the lowest common ancestor between nodes $i$ and $j$.

## Euler Tour Technique
Let $i_x$ and $o_x$ be the in and out times for the tree, which we find through DFS with the Euler tour technique mentioned in [this section](https://usaco.guide/gold/tree-euler).

## Binary Indexed Tree
We create a binary indexed tree which supports range updates and xor queries. Note that the inverse of xor is xor itself.

Store $e_x$ at indices $i_x$ and $o_x$ for all $x$ in the BIT. Note that the prefix xor to $i_x$ is now the path xor from the root node to each node at the tree. See [the solution for Path Queries](https://usaco.guide/solutions/cses-1138) for a comprehensive explanation. 

Let the prefix xor at $i$ be $X(i)$. 

The difference between the explanation for Path Queries and this problem is that we have range xor queries instead of range sum queries. 

This precomputation takes $O(n \lg n)$.

## Responding to Queries
We now need to respond to path queries and updates. To update node $x$, we remove the current values at $i_x$ and $o_x$ and replace these indices with the new value. For a path query, we just output $X(i) \^ X(j) \^ e_{lca(i, j)}$. The $X(i)$ and $X(j)$ are the xor queries for the paths from $0$ to $i$ and $0$ to $j$, respectively. The path from $0$ to $lca(i, j)$ is counted twice and thus negates itself. Thus, we need to also xor $e_{lca(i,j)}$ to account for the full path xor from $i$ to $j$.

LCA precomputation is known to take $O(n \lg n)$ with sparse table. Additionally, updates and queries both take $O(\lg n)$ each, the complexity of the LCA and BIT queries. As there are $q$ updates and queries in total, the total complexity for the querying step is $O(q \lg n)$. Hence, the total complexity is $O((n+q) \lg n)$.
