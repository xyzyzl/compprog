simple sweepline problem, but i still have no clue what was wrong with the impl
the algorithm itself was simple enough, just sort by angles
and then do a sweepline based on the sorted angles; you should always pick consec. region of each
make sure to only do a 180deg window, other wise it will become suboptimal

--- why the fuck is this wrong ---
if i keep the vec and val arrays separate, they don't work
if i integrate both of them into one struct array, the code passes.
this is only true for some test cases.
wtf??????
